// current

- b-mode won't toggle back off
- (minor) on old levels with the simpsons dude, the player sprite will switch during being-born phase due to cached fake sprite.


- trying to erase 2x2 blocks (instead of 4x4) seemed to not work in some cases.

- riding a lift is not smooth when both a crate and the player are on.

- if you stand inside a crumbles until it reappears, nothing happens. should die like red/blu.

- levels on disk are pretty fat (100k+), fix this

- status bar is visible, I think this is both iPad and iPhone.


// old

- if you ever do ship this, remember to turn off NSDebugEnabled, NSZombieEnabled, MallocStackLogging, MallocStackLoggingNoCompact.
