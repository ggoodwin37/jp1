- PRI0: crashes on launch on iphone :(
- PRI1: ipad does not crash, but world size is definitely screwed up, looks like touch input is not mapped to viewport correctly.
^^ related to int sizing issues that popped up recently?

- iphone: launcher screen rotates to portrait too (ipad doesn't)

- trying to erase 2x2 blocks (instead of 4x4) seemed to not work in some cases.

- riding a lift is not smooth when both a crate and the player are on.

- when importing levels onto a new device, lost their order since timestamps changed. might just be puntable.

- if you stand inside a crumbles until it reappears, nothing happens. should die like red/blu.

- (minor) on old levels with the simpsons dude, the player sprite will switch during being-born phase due to cached fake sprite.

- levels on disk are pretty fat (100k+), fix this

// old

- if you ever do ship this, remember to turn off NSDebugEnabled, NSZombieEnabled, MallocStackLogging, MallocStackLoggingNoCompact.

// punted
