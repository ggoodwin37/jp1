- trying to erase 2x2 blocks (instead of 4x4) seemed to not work in some cases.

- riding a lift is not smooth when both a crate and the player are on.

- a crate on a spring bouncing into a low ceiling: crate retains velocity, has an awkward hanging pause before falling again. this doesn't happen for player (headBumpUpdater?). seems minor but will actually be significant for bouncing-button tricks.
