- trying to erase 2x2 blocks (instead of 4x4) seemed to not work in some cases.

- riding a lift is not smooth when both a crate and the player are on.

- if you stand inside a crumbles until it reappears, nothing happens. should die like red/blu.

- levels on disk are pretty fat (100k+), fix this

- status bar is visible, I think this is both iPad and iPhone.

- block props don't propagate across groups like I was hoping. In particular it would be cool to have group'd moving platforms.

- in -(NSDictionary *)loadImagesForSpriteDefList:(NSArray *)spriteDefList,
  there's a comment that non-chalantly mentions a huge perf problem related to reloading sprite image once per sprite. time this.
  actually, just fix this on principle.

- if you ever do ship this, remember to turn off NSDebugEnabled, NSZombieEnabled, MallocStackLogging, MallocStackLoggingNoCompact.
