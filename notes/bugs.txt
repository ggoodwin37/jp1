- trying to erase 2x2 blocks (instead of 4x4) seemed to not work in some cases.

- riding a lift is not smooth when both a crate and the player are on.

- when importing levels onto a new device, lost their order since timestamps changed. might just be puntable.

- if you stand inside a crumbles until it reappears, nothing happens. should die like red/blu.

- (minor) on old levels with the simpsons dude, the player sprite will switch during being-born phase due to cached fake sprite.
