Each batch is just the Documents folder from an app dump, renamed to a unique name.
To put these on a device:
first, xcode->organizer->select device->applications->download, save the original image in ~/tmp or something
make sure app isn't running on device (even in background)
make sure device is passcode unlocked just in case
then, go to the documents folder inside the original image and copy all the levels from a batch into there.
